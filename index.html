      </div>
        <p class="aboutme"> A litle about me. My name is Brevin Scott Cronk. I was born September 3rd, 1998 in St.Louis, Missouri. I was born with Congenital Heart defect and required a few open heart surgeries. Despite this I am living
          the best life i possibly could. At about the age of 4 is when my dad, who was an air force pilot, got stationed at Join Base Lewix-Mccord and we moved to the Puyallup area. Within the next 2 years we ended
        up moving to Gig Harbor. I lived in Gig Harbor for the remainder of my childhood, only moving recently to Seattle to attend Epicodus.</p>

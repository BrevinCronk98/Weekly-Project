        <p class="aboutme"> A litle about me. My name is Brevin Scott Cronk. I was born September 3rd, 1998 in St.Louis, Missouri. I was born with Congenital Heart defect and required a few open heart surgeries. Despite this I am living
          the best life i possibly could. At about the age of 4 is when my dad, who was an air force pilot, got stationed at Join Base Lewix-Mccord and we moved to the Puyallup area. Within the next 2 years we ended
          up moving to Gig Harbor. I lived in Gig Harbor for the remainder of my childhood, only moving recently to Seattle to attend Epicodus.</p>

          <p class="Edu">My Education includes my high school diploma I acquired from graduating from Gig Harbor High School in 2017 and 1 quarter of college. Before Epicodus I had very little Experience
            with programming. I took an intro to CS class in high school where we use scratch to develop programs but that is about it. Right now for work I am a server at Moctezumas Mexican Restaurant and Tequila Bar in Gig Harbor.
            I serve on weekends while doing Epicodus during the week. I actually plan on becoming a web developer for Moctezumas after Epicodus to get my foot in the door for the tech industy
            if the internship options don't turn out well. </p>

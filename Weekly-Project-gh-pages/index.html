        <p class="aboutme"> A litle about me. My name is Brevin Scott Cronk. I was born September 3rd, 1998 in 
          St.Louis, Missouri. I was born with Congenital Heart defect and required a few open heart surgeries. 
          Despite this I am living
          the best life i possibly could. At about the age of 4 is when my dad, who was an air force pilot, got 
          stationed at Join Base Lewix-Mccord and we moved to the Puyallup area. Within the next 2 years we ended
          up moving to Gig Harbor. I lived in Gig Harbor for the remainder of my childhood, only moving recently to Seattle to attend Epicodus.</p>

          <p class="Edu">My Education includes my high school diploma I acquired from graduating from Gig Harbor High School 
            in 2017 and 1 quarter of college. Before Epicodus I had very little Experience
            with programming. I took an intro to CS class in high school where we use scratch 
            to develop programs but that is about it. Right now for work I am a server at Moctezumas Mexican Restaurant and Tequila Bar in Gig Harbor.
            I serve on weekends while doing Epicodus during the week. I actually plan on becoming a 
            web developer for Moctezumas after Epicodus to get my foot in the door for the tech industy
            if the internship options don't turn out well. </p>

            <p class="bonus">In this column I am just going to be talking about some of  my favorite games, 
              experiences and things of that matter. I'll start with games because I love gaming. The top games that 
            I am playing right now are Escape From Tarkov, Mordhau, Modern Warfare, Deep Rock Galactic, Far Cry 5, 
            and Planetary Annihilation. I wish I had more time to relax and 
            play games with my frieds but I am incredibly busy at this point in my life between work and school. 
            Im ok with it though because I know school will be worth is and work gives me the money that I spend.
            An experience of mine that was quiet memorable was the first time I went outdoor rock climbing.
            My buddies and I drove up to the North Cascades near Diablo Lake and I saw some big rocks to 
            try climbing. I did't bring a crash pad which was a bad idea because I ended up falling about 13 feet and landing on 
            my face. I ended up busting my knee open and we had to drive 2 hours to Seattle
            to get stitches put in. Luckily it wasn't as bad as it could've been and i was climbing again in 2 weeks.
            So far I am really enjoying Epicodus and learning how to program.
            I think it is a very interesting thing and I know that majority of objects today depend on it. 
            So now that I am learning it i am beyond excited to learn as much as I can!! </p>
